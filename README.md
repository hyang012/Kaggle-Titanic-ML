# Introduction
This project is my attempt to compete in the Kaggle competition - [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) The goal of the competition is to develop a machine learning model to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. In this project, I used an ensemble model with three classifiers - *Random Forest*, *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees* and *Support Vector Machine*. As of 03/08/2018, the predictions from the ensemble model socre **0.79425** on the public leader board (**top 22%**).
